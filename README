# Small Kondo Corrals data analysis

Read a spectrum (or a series of spectra) from a .VERT file output by the Createc software
Perform a fit of a Fano function over the Kondo resonance around a user-chosen range of values
Get extracted parameters for the Fano resonance
  - linewidth w
  - the center of the Fano lineshape E0
  - the Fano asymmetry parameter q, which can be compared with other values from literature.
